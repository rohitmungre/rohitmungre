## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Rohit, a quantitative software developer based in London, UK.
I have developed trading and analytical systems for institutions across investment banking, hedge funds, commodity trading, and gaming.

I consider myself language agnostic but these days I am focusing on `Python`, `Rust`, & `Javascript`. In the past, I have professionally developed in `C++` and `java`.
